        Hello! I am currently an undergrad student at Binghamton University. I am expected to graduate with my Bachelors
        in CS during Fall of 2024 and am expected to get my Masters in CS during the Fall of 2025. I am working alongside
        the AIR Group led by Shiqi Zhang to assist in researching Reinforcement Learning within a quadruped. Specifically, 
        my current aims are to assist in updating the locomotion policy. I was inspired to create this site due to the lack
        of direct tutorials that I have found that clearly explain how to use Pybullet and OpenAI Gym with Reinforcement 
        Learning.
